# YOLOv3 Object Detection

This project implements an image and video UAVs(unmanned aerial vehicle) detection classifier using new trained yolov3 model. The yolov3 models are taken from the official yolov3 paper which was released in 2018. The yolov3 implementation is from darknet.

## How to use?

by following https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet installation steps, you could start using this pretrained model for detecting UAVs or even retrain it again using uploaded dataset and their labels.
